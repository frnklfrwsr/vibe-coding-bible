# INDEX_BY_TOOL_CATEGORY

> Status: Current routing index. Entries marked active have authored source files; entries marked planned are future routes.

## Tool-Card Inventory Policy

- Canonical active tool-card inventory lives in `TOOL_REGISTER.md` and the consolidated `README.md` tool-card inventory.
- This index keeps semantic category routes and does not maintain generation-specific aggregate inventory blocks.
- When adding or activating tools, route the smallest active tool card inside the relevant semantic sections before chapter, workflow, shortcut, or planned fallbacks.
