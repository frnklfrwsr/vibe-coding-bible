- `vcb.shortcut.consensus_as_correctness` → active companion
- `vcb.shortcut.many_ais_same_files` → active companion


## Generated prototype becomes production foundation

- `tool.figma` → active companion: design/prototype intent must be checked against implementation and browser evidence before production use
- `tool.docker` → active companion: generated prototype dependencies and services need reproducible, reviewable local setup before hardening
- `tool.linear` → active companion: production-hardening work needs issue ownership, scope, and acceptance evidence
- `tool.replit` → active: browser-based prototyping, hosted development, learning apps, and quick demo publishing with review/exit-path guardrails
- `tool.lovable` → active: AI full-stack app-builder for product sketches, MVP flow validation, generated app review, and publish/handoff guardrails
- `tool.bolt` → active: browser-based website/app/mobile prototype builder with token, dependency, generated-code, and publish-review guardrails
- `tool.v0` → active: AI UI/frontend generation for high-fidelity screens, design-system prototypes, and reviewable frontend starting points
- `vcb.shortcut.real_secrets_in_prototype` → active: prototype secrets/data boundary
- `vcb.constraints.production_quality` → active companion: production-readiness evidence
- `vcb.chapter.first_serious_app` → active fallback

## Foundational failure-mode concepts

- `tool.supabase` → active: database/schema/RLS/backend mistakes can create persistent data failures
- `tool.clerk` → active: auth/session/user/org mistakes can create access failures
- `tool.auth0` → active: IAM/OIDC/OAuth/API mistakes can create authorization failures
- `tool.stripe` → active: payment/subscription/webhook mistakes can create customer and revenue failures
- `tool.sentry` → active: missing error/trace/release evidence makes production failures harder to diagnose
- `tool.posthog` → active: bad event taxonomy, replay, or flags can produce false product conclusions
- `tool.vercel` → active: deployment/environment mistakes can mask production-readiness failures
- `vcb.concepts.frontend_backend` → active: frontend-only fixes hide backend/security bugs
- `vcb.concepts.database_schema` → active: persistent data shape changes are made casually
- `vcb.concepts.authentication` → active: identity proof is confused with access permission
- `vcb.concepts.authorization` → active: missing permission checks expose protected actions
- `vcb.concepts.environment_variable` → active: secrets leak through configs, logs, or prompts
- `vcb.concepts.observability` → active: production claims lack logs/metrics/traces/errors

## Local environment, design-handoff, and planning-tool failures

- `tool.docker` → active: environment drift, container works-on-my-machine failures, image provenance gaps, unsafe mounts/ports, and secret leakage into Docker artifacts
- `tool.figma` → active: design handoff drift, missing states, prototype-overtrust, screenshot-only acceptance, and design-code mismatch
- `tool.linear` → active: stale tickets, status theater, missing owners, overloaded projects, and planning without acceptance evidence
- `tool.github_actions` → active companion when container/setup checks or workflow evidence matter
- `tool.playwright` → active companion when Figma/UI evidence must be verified in the browser
- `vcb.shortcut.trusting_external_tool_output` → active companion
- `vcb.chapter.tool_stack_catalog` → active fallback

## Hosting, backend/auth, payment, observability, and analytics failure routes

- `tool.vercel` → active: hosting, preview deployments, environment separation, deployment evidence, and production promotion guardrails
- `tool.supabase` → active: Postgres database/backend/auth/storage, schema/RLS, migrations, backups, functions, and data-access guardrails
- `tool.clerk` → active: authentication, user management, sessions, organizations, and application identity guardrails
- `tool.auth0` → active: IAM, OAuth/OIDC, applications/APIs, enterprise/B2B identity, and authorization architecture guardrails
- `tool.stripe` → active: payments, subscriptions, checkout, webhooks, billing state, and real-money fulfillment guardrails
- `tool.sentry` → active: error monitoring, tracing, performance, release evidence, and production debugging guardrails
- `tool.posthog` → active: product analytics, event taxonomy, session replay, feature flags, experiments, and product-evidence guardrails

## Ecosystem coverage failure modes

- `tool.cloudflare` → active: DNS/CDN/cache/edge routing works in summary but breaks production traffic, security posture, or rollback.
- `tool.netlify` → active: deploy preview/function/environment context differs from production or hides release risk.
- `tool.neon` → active: database branch, migration, connection, or preview-data workflow is mistaken for production-safe data change.
- `tool.resend` → active: transactional email integration sends to real users, leaks data, or lacks delivery/error evidence.
- `tool.vitest` → active: unit/component tests pass but are weak, misconfigured, or treated as full product proof.
- `tool.storybook` → active: isolated UI stories look correct while app states, accessibility, or design-code drift remain untested.
- Deferred ecosystem tool → `TOOL_REGISTER.md` coverage audit first; use companion card and current vendor docs instead of pretending no route exists.
